  To help you out, here are some styles that are applied:

  ```
  container div width -> 200px;
  background color -> purple;
  left side border color -> green;
  left side border thickness -> 5 pixels;
  padding on all sides in div -> 10px;
  text font size -> 20 pixels
  heading color -> white
  ```

  Edit `style.css` & `main.html` to get this exact image output and pass test cases
